# Compare_CPP_Programs
I wrote this in 2019 back when spojtoolkit was working.
The toolkit doesnt work now so this has also become rogue.I hope it comes back.
I am uploading this just because it was too much usefull for me back at the time and also
because I dont have anything else to uploat here.


----------------------------ABOUT---------------------------------

This script takes test cases from spojtoolkit.com for a particular problem("You have to provide its problem code")
and then compares two c++ or c program for those test cases.

------------------------HOW TO RUN THIS---------------------------

1.Make sure you have the c++ compiler.(mingw for windows or any other, and also its path has been set)
2.Download the repository.
2.Paste one of the program in prog1.cpp and the other in prog2.cpp.
3.Run the Main.exe file OR just type "python run_this.py" in the terminal.
